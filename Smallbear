ZKM Vision & Mission
To facilitate Ethereum as the Global Settlement Layer for secure, verifiable computing.
We firmly believe in the necessity for a decentralized and trustworthy internet. To accomplish this in an efficient way that is optimized for users, the presently fragmented blockchain space requires complete unification and seamless interoperability.
To solve this issue, ZKM aims to significantly enhance and cohere the decentralized internet in an unparalleled way, eventually making possible the integration of non-blockchain systems into blockchain.
